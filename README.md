## Motivation

The aim of the analysis is to get the package format of the [Renkforce AOK-5055](https://www.conrad.de/de/renkforce-aok-5055-funk-wetterstation-vorhersage-fuer-12-bis-24-stunden-1267773.html).

## Used Tools

Hardware

1. DVB-T USB stick (rtl chipset), as cheap software defined radio.

Software

1. Kali Linux
1. urh 2.5.6 - [Universal Radio Hacker](https://github.com/jopohl/urh), for receiving, analysing and decoding signals.

## Setup

### Setup Tools

1. Install dependencies for `urh`, also `librtlsdr-dev`.
1. Install `urh` by `pip`.
1. Plugin DVB-T stick.

### Setup Weather Station

Assamble the station as described in the manual, but do not cover the sender module. Access to the batteries is useful to do a quick reset.

## Initial Thoughts

### What we search?

Values sent from outdoor to indoor station. The indoor station shows following values according to the manual:

 * temperature
 * humidiy
 * wind direction
 * wind speed
 * rain volum
 * low battery

Maybe some additional basic values of protocol design:
 
 * preamble
 * protocol version
 * device identification
 * checksum

### What bit range?

 * temperature
   * -20-70Â°C = diff 90 => 7 bit
 * humidiy
   * 20-95% = diff 75 => 7 bit or 6 bit
 * wind direction
   * 16 directions => 4 bit
 * wind speed
   * 0~256kmh => 8 bit
 * rain volum
   * 0~999.9MM => 14 bit
   * smalles step 0,7mm next 1,5mm suggested step about 0,75mm = 1333 steps => 11 bit
 * low battery
   * 1 bit
 
## Analytics

### Hardware

Just teardown the hardware (sender and receiver) and look for the used IC to send the signals. The case can be easily open by a normal screwdriver.
On the pcb a `PT4302` can be found which is a `Ultra-Low Power OOK/ASK Receiver` for `315 MHz/433.92 MHz`.
In Europe only `433.92 MHz` can be used, so we look in this range for signals.

### Package Format

#### Checksum

The checksum is not completly clear. It seems to be a XOR of all bytes, but it is a bit different. Pseudo code formula (names does not exactly match the package format):
```php
0x47 ^ $id ^ $bat ^ $temp ^ $hum ^ $rain ^ $wind ^ $dir ^ $check
```

Exact formula:
```
0x47 ^ byte1 ^ byte2 ^ byte3 ^ byte4 ^ byte5 ^ byte6 ^ byte7 ^ check_byte == 0x00
```

But with the test set of messages there is a difference. According to the `byte4` (humidity) the checksum fails if `byte4 & 0x0f` is different.

After analysing the test messages is seems to be following assosiaction between `byte4 & 0x0f` and offset after calcutation.
```
    [0] => b
    [1] => 8
    [2] => d
    [3] => e
    [4] => 7
    [5] => 7
    [6] => 1
    [7] => 2
    [8] => 0
    [9] => 3
    [a] => 5
    [b] => 6
    [c] => f
    [d] => c
    [e] => 9
    [f] => a
```

In the list you can see, that there is no bidirectional relation. There are `4` and `5` which result in `7`. I did not figure out how they calculate the checksum. Maybe they have a bug in the calculation of the checksum.
